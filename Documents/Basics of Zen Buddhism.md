## Basics of Zen Buddhism

> *"Not to do any evil,  
To embrace the good,  
To purify one’s mind:  
This is the teaching of Buddhas."*

Buddhas' teaching is supposed to be that simple. :)

Let us unpack some of the most important terms in modern *Buddhism* today.

---

In the sūtras —the canonical scriptures of Buddhism— Buddha is said to reject conventional knowledge structures in favor of direct experience:

> *"Come now; don’t rely on what you hear, don’t rely on tradition, don’t rely on testament, don’t rely on scriptures, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t rely on analysis, don’t rely on a view after deliberation, don’t rely on charisma, and don’t rely on our respectable ascetics — **but know for yourselves**."*  
> — *Kesamutti Sūtra*

Despite the reverence this sūtra receives, many Buddhists today defer unquestioningly to scriptures, monastic authority, logic, and tradition. The irony is hard to ignore.

Buddhism begins as an Indian ascetic's attempt to diagnose and let go of **duḥkha**. 

That’s where consensus ends.

The translation for *duḥkha* has ossified as “suffering”, though this definition is rightly contested. The word in its literal sense describes a misaligned chariot axle, and so the word is a metaphor for a rough, unstable ride. This implication is less about pain, and more about unreliability, structural friction, or unsatisfactoriness.

Buddha teaches us the **dharma**.

What *dharma* means is vague, and highly depends on the context. It may refer to "reality", "the truth", "(nature's) law", "phenomenon", or "principle"—except when it's used to mean *the word of the Buddha* explicitly in the monastic code.

> *"Just as the great sea has but one taste—the taste of salt—so too does this **dharma** and discipline have but one taste: **the taste of freedom**."*
>
> — *Udāna 5.5*

---

While it is difficult to find doctrinal unity across Buddhist traditions, most agree on the three marks of conditioned existence:

- **Anātman** — all *dharmā* are **not-self**.  
- **Anitya** — all *dharmā* are **impermanent**.  
- **Duḥkha** — all *saṃskārā* are **unsatisfactory**.

*Anātman* can be read epistemically (“No law explains a self”), phenomenologically (“No phenomenon is self”), or ontologically (“There is no self”). It should be obvious that all these readings are in conflict with one another.

*Anitya* is often reduced to “everything changes,” which oversimplifies both its scope and its implications.

Curiously, *dharmā* are said to be not-self and impermanent, while *saṃskāra*—fabricated or conditioned things—are said to be *duḥkha*. 

It appears that some things are *dharmā*, while some things are *saṃskārā*. The significance of this distinction remains unresolved across traditions.

**Nirvāṇa** is the express goal of the Buddhist path but there is no consensus on what it actually is.

The word is metaphorical. It refers to the extinguishing of a flame.

Broadly, *nirvāṇa* signifies escape from *saṃsāra*—literally "going around"; this existence, the cycle of birth-and-death rebirth.

Some present *nirvāṇa* as **epistemic clarity**—the cessation of delusion.  

Others, as **ontological release**—the cessation of causal formations.

Interpretations vary widely, with common claims describing it as a state, a realization, a cessation, or a type of special consciousness.

This “extinguishing” is often framed in the negatives: extinguishing of craving, becoming, aversion, hatred, delusion. Or all of the above.

Sometimes, it's framed in the positive: The secure, the wonderful, the haven, etc.

Some say it is unborn, some say it's free of born things.

Some schools reject dualities altogether, claiming that *nirvāṇa* and *saṃsāra* are **indistinguishable**—but **not identical** either.

Within Buddhist history, two major archetypes of awakening developed, each representing distinct emphases in path and aim:

The **arhat** ("worthy one") reaches *nirvāṇa* through direct insight, extinguishing craving, and no longer generating *karma* ("activity") that binds one to *saṃsāra*. The goal is personal liberation, realized through virtuous conduct, meditative absorption, and insight into *anātman*, *anitya*, and *duḥkha*.

The **bodhisattva** ("awakening being") vows to attain full Buddhahood not for personal escape, but to guide all beings to liberation.

This ideal reorients the path. Instead of treating *nirvāṇa* as cessation, it emphasizes wisdom and compassion held simultaneously. In some interpretations, the bodhisattva does not seek to exit *saṃsāra*, but to awaken fully *within* it.

These two ideals are often framed in contrast, but both remain embedded within Buddhist traditions as complementary responses to the question: *what does freedom mean, and for whom is it sought?*

This second position, the **bodhisattva** ideal, forms the basis of **Mahāyāna** thought, meaning the school of *The Great Vehicle*, which the *Ch'an* sect is a part of.

*Ch’an* (禪, from *dhyāna*, often translated into *meditation* or *absorption*) develops in 6th–9th century China as a syncretic movement blending Buddhist meditation theory, Daoist expression, and native Chinese lineage politics.

It positions itself as a “mind-to-mind transmission outside scriptures,” though its texts and debates are voluminous.

*Zen* (禅, Japanese reading of Ch’an) travels to Japan via monastic networks, where it becomes embedded in court, warrior, and artistic culture.

Dōgen (1200–1253), founder of the Sōtō school, studies in China and returns with a unique synthesis of seated meditation called *Zazen* (坐禅) and strict monastic discipline.

**Zazen** (坐禅) means “seated meditation”. Here's *zazen* in Dōgen's own words:

> *“Tune into your body. Tune into your breath. Settle down.*  
> *Sway left and right, then sit upright like a rock.*  
> *Fathom the unfathomable.*
> 
> *How do you fathom the unfathomable?*  
> *Fathomless!*  
> *This is the essential art of zazen.*
>  
> *What's called zazen is the non-practice of meditation—*  
> *just so the dharma gate of joyful ease.”*
>  
> — *Dōgen, Fukanzazengi*

These days, “Zen” is as likely to brand a bar of soap or a minimalist furniture line as it is to describe a 13th-century Japanese monastic.

If nothing else, its journey from *kōan* stories to consumer packaging proves the Buddha was right about impermanence.

At its core, *Buddhism* can be seen as a response to the longing for freedom, rooted in the insights of an Indian ascetic, filtered through millennia of institutional repackaging. All the current scriptures and their exegesis should be viewed from this critical lens.

Yet, despite all this confusion, there exists a great spirit of inquiry and culture of debate within Buddhist communities; and the literature of Buddhism remains a remarkable—if at times self-contradictory and cryptic—resource for studying behavioral ethics and epistemic deconstruction.

When asked to summarize the teaching, the Buddha reframes **dharma** in practical, affective terms:

> *"You might know that certain things lead to passion, not dispassion; to yoking, not unyoking; to accumulation, not dispersal; to more desires, not fewer; to discontent, not contentment; to crowding, not seclusion; to laziness, not energy; to being burdensome, not unburdensome. These should be remembered as **not dharma**, not the discipline, and not the Teacher’s instruction.*

> — *Aṅguttara Nikāya 8.53*

Even then, **dharma** is not something to hold on to. It can be considered as a medicine, the aim of which is to free the person from needing to take medicine altogether. 

> *"Monks, I will teach you the **dharma** compared to a raft—for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto."*  
> *Majjhima Nikāya 22*
