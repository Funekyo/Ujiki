## Basics of Zen Buddhism

> *"Not to do any evil,  
To embrace the good,  
To purify one’s mind:  
This is the teaching of Buddhas."*

Buddhism is supposed to be simple as that.  

Apparently, it isn't. :)

Buddha is said to reject conventional knowledge structures in favor of direct experience.

> *"Come now; don’t rely on what you hear, don’t rely on tradition, don’t rely on testament, don’t rely on scriptures, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t rely on analysis, don’t rely on a view after deliberation, don’t rely on charisma, and don’t rely on our respectable ascetics — but know for yourselves."*  
> — *Kesamutti Sūtra*

Despite the reverence this sūtra receives, many Buddhists today defer unquestioningly to scriptures, monastic authority, logic, and tradition. The irony is hard to ignore.

When asked to summarize the teaching, the Buddha reframes **dharma** in practical, affective terms:

> *"You might know that certain things lead to passion, not dispassion; to yoking, not unyoking; to accumulation, not dispersal; to more desires, not fewer; to discontent, not contentment; to crowding, not seclusion; to laziness, not energy; to being burdensome, not unburdensome. These should be remembered as not the principle, not the discipline, and not the Teacher’s instruction.*

These should be remembered as the principle, the discipline, and the Teacher’s instruction.”*

Buddhism begins as an Indian ascetic's attempt to diagnose and overcome **duḥkha**. That’s where consensus ends.

The translation for *duḥkha* has ossified as “suffering”, though this definition is rightly contested. The word in its literal sense describes a misaligned chariot axle, and so the word is a metaphor for a rough, unstable ride. This implication is less about pain, and more about unreliability, structural friction, or unsatisfactoriness.

It is difficult to find doctrinal unity across Buddhist traditions, but most agree on three shared marks of conditioned experience:

- **Anātman** — all *dharma* are not-self  
- **Anitya** — all *dharma* are impermanent  
- **Duḥkha** — all *saṃskāra* are unsatisfactory

What *dharma* means is debated. It may refer to nature's law, phenomenon, or principle—my preferred translation—except when used to mean *the teaching* explicitly in the monastic code.

*Anātman* can be read epistemically (“No law explains a self”), phenomenologically (“No phenomenon is self”), or ontologically (“There is no self”).

*Anitya* is often collapsed into “everything changes,” which oversimplifies both scope and context.

Curiously, *dharma* are said to be not-self and impermanent, while *saṃskāra*—fabricated or conditioned things—are said to be *duḥkha*. The significance of this disctinction remains unresolved across traditions.

*Nirvāṇa* is the express goal of the Buddhist path but there is no consensus on what it actually is.

The word is metaphorical: *nir* (“out”) + *vāṇa* (“blowing”) refers to the extinguishing of a flame.

Broadly, *nirvāṇa* signifies escape from *saṃsāra*—literally "going around", this existence, the cycle of birth-and-death rebirth.

This “extinguishing” is often framed in the negatives: extinguishing of craving, becoming, aversion, hatred, delusion. Or all of the above.

Interpretations vary wildly, with common claims describing it is a state, a realization, a cessatio, or a type of special consciousness.

Some present *nirvāṇa* as **epistemic clarity**—the cessation of delusion.  

Others, as **metaphysical unbinding**—the cessation of causal formations.

Some schools reject dualities, claiming that *nirvāṇa* and *saṃsāra* are **indistinguishable**—but **not identical** either.

Within Buddhist history, two major archetypes of awakening developed, each representing distinct emphases in path and aim:

The **arhat** ("worthy one") reaches *nirvāṇa* through direct insight, extinguishing craving, and no longer generating karma that binds one to *saṃsāra*. The goal is personal liberation, realized through ethical restraint, meditative absorption, and insight into impermanence, not-self, and suffering.

The **bodhisattva** ("awakening being") vows to attain full Buddhahood not for personal escape, but to guide all beings to liberation.

This ideal reorients the path. Instead of treating *nirvāṇa* as cessation, it emphasizes wisdom and compassion held simultaneously. In some interpretations, the bodhisattva does not seek to exit *saṃsāra*, but to awaken fully *within* it.

These two ideals are often framed in contrast, but both remain embedded within Buddhist traditions as complementary responses to the question: *what does freedom mean, and for whom is it sought?*

This second position, the **bodhisattva** ideal forms the basis of **Mahāyāna** thought, meaning the school of *The Great Vehicle*.

*Ch’an* (禪, from *dhyāna*, meaning something like *meditation*) develops in 6th–9th century China as a syncretic movement blending Indian meditation theory, Daoist expression, and native Chinese lineage politics.

It positions itself as a “mind-to-mind transmission outside scriptures,” though its texts and debates are voluminous.

*Zen* (禅, Japanese reading of Ch’an) travels to Japan via monastic networks, where it becomes embedded in court, warrior, and artistic culture.

Dōgen (1200–1253), founder of the Sōtō school, studies in China and returns with a unique synthesis of strict monastic practice and seated meditation, called *Zazen* (坐禅).

These days, “Zen” is as likely to describe a brand of soap or a minimalist furniture ad as it is a 13th-century Japanese monastic.  

If nothing else, its journey from *kōan* stories to consumer packaging proves the Buddha was right about impermanence.

---

At its core, *Buddhism* can be seen as a response to the human longing for freedom, rooted in the insights of an Indian ascetic, filtered through centuries of institutional and industrial repackaging.

Yet, despite all this confusion, there exists a great debative culture and a spirit of inquiry within Buddhist communities, and the literature of Buddhism stands as an exceptional—if at times self-contradictory and cryptic—source of inspiration to study behavioral ethics and epistemic deconstruction.

If you were to ask me what **dharma** means, I would quote one of my favourite sūtras:

> *"Just as the great sea has but one taste—the taste of salt—so too does this **dharma** and discipline have but one taste: the taste of freedom."*  
> — *Udāna 5.5*

Even then, **dharma** is not something to hold on to. It can be considered as a medicine, the aim of which is to free the person from needing to take medicine altogether. 

> *"Monks, I will teach you the **dharma** compared to a raft—for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto."*  
> *Majjhima Nikāya 22*
