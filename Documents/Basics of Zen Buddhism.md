*"Come now; don’t rely on what you hear, don’t rely on tradition, don’t rely on testament, don’t rely on scriptures, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t rely on analysis, don’t rely on a view after deliberation, don’t rely on charisma, and don’t rely on our respectable ascetics - but know for yourselves."* Kesamutti Sutta
