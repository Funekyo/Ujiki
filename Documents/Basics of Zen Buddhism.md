*"Not to do any evil,  
To embrace the good,  
To purify one’s mind:  
This is the teaching of Buddhas."*  

Buddhism is supposed to be simple as that. Apparently, it isn't. :)



*"Come now; don’t rely on what you hear, don’t rely on tradition, don’t rely on testament, don’t rely on scriptures, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t rely on analysis, don’t rely on a view after deliberation, don’t rely on charisma, and don’t rely on our respectable ascetics - but know for yourselves."* Kesamutti Sutta

*"You might know that certain things lead to passion, not dispassion; to yoking, not to unyoking; to accumulation, not dispersal; to more desires, not fewer; to lack of contentment, not contentment; to crowding, not seclusion; to laziness, not energy; to being burdensome, not being unburdensome. Categorically, you should remember these things as not the teaching, not the training, and not the Teacher’s instructions.

*"Just as the great sea only has the taste of salt; likewise this principle and discipline only has the taste of freedom."* Ud 5.5
