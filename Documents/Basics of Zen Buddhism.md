*"Come now; don’t rely on what you hear, don’t rely on tradition, don’t rely on testament, don’t rely on scriptures, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t rely on analysis, don’t rely on a view after deliberation, don’t rely on charisma, and don’t rely on our respectable ascetics - but know for yourselves."* Kesamutti Sutta

*"Just as the great sea only has the taste of salt; likewise this principle and discipline only has the taste of freedom."* Ud 5.5
