# 有時記 - Ujiki
*A curious study of Dōgen's Zen poetry using AI tools for ethical translation, linguistic analysis, and structured creative interpretation.*

***uji*** - *"time being", "being time", "for a while"*

***ujiki*** - *"a record of time being for a while"*

**This project explores how AI tools can be used with epistemic clarity and ethical intention to analyse and re-imagine the poetry of Zen Master Dōgen. The focus is on translation, grammatical analysis, and creative rendering—not as automation, but as a means to bring ancient stillness into the turmoil of the now.**

I treat AI not as a shortcut but as a lens, testing how it can support human understanding, poetic presence, and creative work.

AI-generated responses are compared with human references to observe convergence and divergence, merging output into poetry that resonate with the Dharma.

In addition to poetic musings, the scope includes linguistic analysis, translation choices, and structured data output. You will als find meta-articles exploring Dōgen’s thought, Zen Buddhism, and translation practice.

Applications include reference material, learning tools, and automation frameworks such as spreadsheets, flashcards, or code.

Each poem becomes a site of failure, recursion, and presence.
