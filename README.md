## 🌸 introduction

***有時 uji*** - *"time being", "being time", "for a while"*

***有時記 ujiki*** - *"chronicles of time being for a while"*

**Welcome!** This project explores how AI tools can assist in reading, translating, and reflecting on Zen Master Dōgen’s poetry—without replacing human interpretation. It tests how machines can support precision, ambiguity, and presence within poetic language.

Through poetry, I focus on virtue, linguistic analysis, structured data output, translation, and verbal & visual creative rendering—all for unearthing ancient stillness in the turmoil of the now.

I treat LLMs as automation tools for structural tasks (flashcards, spreadsheets, and similar tools) but not for automating understanding. There, I test its application as a lens to support human insight, poetic presence, and creative work.

I treat AI is symbolically as an assistant, as a way to explore semantic space through prompt and response, grounded in the dialogue between the user and the data of collective human language.

I compare AI-generated responses with human references—beyond redundancy—to observe where they converge and diverge. I then merge these insights into poetry that resonates with the Dharma as I understand it.

In addition to poetic musings, you will also find meta-articles exploring Dōgen, Zen Buddhism, and ethics of AI, along with the tools I've built. 

Each poem is a site of recursive, temporal, and ever-whimsical failure. I hope they will give you a reason to pause and breathe in joyful ease. :)

> *The red dust of the everyday affairs cannot reach here by flight*  
> *To my grass hut in the depths of the mountain on this snowy night."*

## 📝 notes

Work-in-progress by **[Funekyo](https://github.com/Funekyo)**.

**The project exists as an experimental performance art.** Time will tell where it'll lead us.  

**Feedback & company are most welcome.** Feel free to reach out to discuss AI, ethics, Dōgen, Dhamma poetry & wenwan walnuts.

**If this project resonates with you, please consider offering support.** This is a long-term attempt to understand how human-AI collaboration can deepen—not flatten—poetic and contemplative thought. I’m looking for patrons who see value in such efforts.
