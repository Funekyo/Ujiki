***uji*** - *"time is being", "being is time", "for a while"*

***ujiki*** - *"a record of time being for a while"*

**This project explores how AI tools can be used with epistemic clarity and ethical intention to work with the poetry of Zen Master Dōgen. The focus is on translation, grammatical analysis, and creative rendering—not as automation, but as a means to bring ancient stillness into the turmoil of the now.**

I treat AI not as a shortcut but as a lens, testing how it can support human understanding, poetic presence, and creative work.

In addition to poetic musings, the scope includes translation variants, linguistic analysis and structured data output.

Applications include reference material, learning tools and automation frameworks such as spreadsheets, flashcards, or code.  

Each poem becomes a site of failure, recursion, and presence.
