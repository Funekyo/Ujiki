***uji*** - *"time is being", "being is time", "for a while"*

***ujiki*** - *"a record of time being for a while"*

**This project attempts to chronicle the usefulness & challenges of using AI tools for a very humane project - namely, translating Zen Master Dōgen's poetry.**

An attempt to slow down and have an excuse to talk about the moonlight, while hoping for a brighter future for humans with machines and every other sentient being.

IN addition to poetic musics, tThe scope includes translation variants, linguistic analysis and structured data output.

Applications include reference material, learning tools and automation frameworks such as spreadsheets, flashcards, or code.  

Each poem becomes a site of failure, recursion, and presence.
