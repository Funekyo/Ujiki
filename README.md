# 有時記 - Ujiki
*A curious study of Dōgen's Zen poetry using AI tools for lucid translation, linguistic analysis, and structured creative interpretation.*

**This project explores how AI tools can be used ethically and with epistemic clarity to analyse and reimagine the poetry of Zen Master Dōgen. The focus is on translation, grammatical analysis, and creative rendering—not as automation, but as a means to bring ancient stillness into the turmoil of the now.**

I treat AI as an automation tool for structural tasks (reference lists, flashcards, spreadsheets, and similar tools) but not for automating understanding. In that domain, I test its application as a lens to support human insight, poetic presence, and creative work.

AI is treated symbolically as a co-contributor: a way to explore semantic space through reflection and response, grounded in the data of collective human language.

AI-generated responses are compared with human references to observe convergence and divergence, merging output into poetry that resonates with the Dharma.

In addition to poetic musings, the scope includes linguistic analysis, translation choices, and structured data output. You will also find meta-articles exploring Dōgen’s thought, Zen Buddhism, and translation practice.

Each poem becomes a site of failure, recursion, and presence.
