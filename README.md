# ÊúâÊôÇË®ò - Ujiki
*A personal chronicle of reimagining D≈çgen's Zen poetry using legacy and AI tools for linguistic analysis and translation.*

*"I relay to the east the sacred way of elders from the west:*  
*Fishing the moon, plowing the clouds, admiring the ancient tempest;*  
*The red dust of the everyday affairs can not reach here by flight*  
*To my grass hut in the depths of the mountain on this snowy night."*

***uji*** - *"time being", "being time", "for a while"*

***ujiki*** - *"chronicles of time being for a while"*

**This project explores how AI tools can assist in reading, translating, and reflecting on Zen Master D≈çgen‚Äôs poetry without replacing human interpretation, testing how machines can support precision, ambiguity, and presence in poetic language. The focus is on translation, grammatical analysis, verbal & visual creative rendering, as a means to bring ancient stillness into the turmoil of the now.**

I treat LLMs as an automation tool for structural tasks (reference lists, flashcards, spreadsheets, and similar tools) but not for automating understanding. In that domain, I test its application as a lens to support human insight, poetic presence, and creative work.

**AI is treated symbolically as a co-contributor:** a way to explore semantic space through reflection and response, grounded in the accumulated data of collective human language.

AI-generated responses are compared with human references‚Äîbeyond the point of redundancy‚Äîto observe convergence and divergence. Finally, I merge all data into poetry that resonates with the Dharma as I understand it.

In addition to poetic musings, the scope includes linguistic analysis, translation process, and structured data output. You will also find meta-articles exploring D≈çgen, Zen Buddhism, and ethics of AI.

Each poem becomes a site of recursive, temporal, and ever whimsical failure.

## üìù notes

Work-in-progress by **[Funekyo](link)**.

**The project exists as an experimental performance art.** Time will there where it'll lead us.  

**Feedback & company are most welcome.** Feel free to reach out to discuss AI, ethics, D≈çgen, Dhamma poetry & wenwan walnuts.

**Kindly consider supporting** if this project aligns with your interests. This is a long-term attempt to understand how human-AI collaboration can deepen‚Äînot flatten‚Äîpoetic and contemplative thought. I‚Äôm looking for patrons who see value in such efforts.
