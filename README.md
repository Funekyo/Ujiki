# 有時記 - Ujiki
*A curious study of Dōgen's Zen poetry using AI tools for linguistic analysis, translation and creative interpretation.*

***uji*** - *"time being", "being time", "for a while"*

***ujiki*** - *"chronicles of time being for a while"*

**This project explores how AI tools can be used ethically and with epistemic lucidity to analyse and reimagine the poetry of Zen Master Dōgen. The focus is on translation, grammatical analysis, and creative rendering, as a means to bring ancient stillness into the turmoil of the now.**

I treat LLMs as an automation tool for structural tasks (reference lists, flashcards, spreadsheets, and similar tools) but not for automating understanding. In that domain, I test its application as a lens to support human insight, poetic presence, and creative work.

**AI is treated symbolically as a co-contributor:** a way to explore semantic space through reflection and response, grounded in the data of collective human language.

AI-generated responses are compared with human references to a point beyond redundancy, to observe convergence and divergence. Finally, I merge all data into poetry that resonates with the Dharma as I understand it.

In addition to poetic musings, the scope includes linguistic analysis, translation process, and structured data output. You will also find meta-articles exploring Dōgen, Zen Buddhism, and ethics of AI.

Each poem becomes a site of whimsical failure—recursive and temporal.
