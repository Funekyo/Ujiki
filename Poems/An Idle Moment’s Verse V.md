### Notes

- Heine says for third line: “Although the wording in the Monkaku version explains the idea by using negative rhetoric—​’But there is one more matter that must not be overlooked’ (雖然尚有難忘事)—​the outlook of dedication to teaching remains the same.”

- As for the last line, it refers to the town of Fukakusa (深草), literally “deep grass,” a site that served as a rustic getaway for the elite living in the capital during the Heian period. This was also where Dōgen established Kōshōji temple. I still think there’s a bit of wordplay here, so I chose to evoke the image of rain dropping on grass.
